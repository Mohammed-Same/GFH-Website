# Connect Nation Pro Landing Page

This is a custom [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) website inspired by [connect-nation-pro.lovable.app](https://connect-nation-pro.lovable.app), featuring a modern landing page with hero, features, testimonials, and call-to-action sections. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Next.js App Router.

	```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.
